# Next.js Component Re-rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Next.js applications where a component fails to re-render after data is fetched within a `useEffect` hook.  The `MyComponent` initially displays "Loading..." but doesn't update to show the fetched data.

The problem stems from how Next.js handles component rendering and state updates.  The solution involves understanding how to trigger re-renders efficiently.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Observe that the `MyComponent` remains stuck on "Loading..." even after the data fetch completes.

## Solution

The solution demonstrates how to fix the issue.  See the `bugSolution.js` file for a corrected implementation.
